      decide which player won the game.

      HINT: You can use the Options variable to be access the
      different possible options for rock, paper and scissors.

      The Outcomes variable holds each possible outcome and can
      be used when deciding whether the player won, lost or drew.

      The playerChoice and pcChoice variables store whether each
      player selected rock, paper or scissors.

      Remember to use console.log to inspect the data!
